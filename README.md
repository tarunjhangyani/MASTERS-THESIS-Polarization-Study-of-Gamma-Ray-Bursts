# MASTERS-THESIS-Polarization-Study-of-Gamma-Ray-Bursts
The thesis sought to discover and quantify the presence of polarization signatures in the prompt emission phase of a gamma ray burst (GRB).
Two GRBs were investigated using data from the CZTI AstroSat. Two approaches were used to estimate the polarisation specific quantities
polarisation angle and polarisation percent. One is the traditional least squares approach of curve fitting. Another use of Bayesian inference
is the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods. Further polarization signatures were scrutinized using the Bayesâ€™ factor calculation. One GRB was
found to be polarised, whereas another was found to be unpolarized.
